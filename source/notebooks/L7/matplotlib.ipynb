Much like the case of pandas being built upon [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), plotting in pandas takes advantage of plotting features from the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) plotting library. Plotting in pandas provides a basic framework for visualizing our data, but as you'll see we will sometimes need to also use features from Matplotlib to enhance our plots. In particular, we will use features from the the `pyplot` module in Matplotlib, which provides [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)-like plotting."

Bar plots are one option, which can be used quite similarly to line plots with the addition of the `kind=bar` parameter.

For the y-axis, we can still define its range using the `ylim=[ymin, ymax]` parameter.
