1. Go to our **Discord** page at https://geo-python2021.slack.com.
2. **Post a new message** in the `#week-1 <https://geo-python2021.slack.com/archives/C02D923SLTT>`__ channel with your **full name, GitHub username, year and course** (GEOK_3030 or GEOG-329-1).

For example,
``JD Aianala, jdaled, teacher since 2011``

(please use comma to separate the different parts).
This will help us know you were able to create your account, that you have also figured out how to use Slack, and we'll know who is who on GitHub :).

.. note::

    In case you're curious, we need your GitHub user name in order to access your exercise repositories in GitHub
    for grading and feedback.

.. admonition:: Start your assignment

    **You can start working on your copy of Exercise 1 by** `accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment <https://classroom.github.com/a/YX0hqGaH>`__.


1. Start the coding exercise by accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment (click on the link above).
2. Read the instructions from the repository.
3. Launch a new JupyterLab instance. *You can use Binder.*
4. Cook up some Python according to the instructions!  *Remember to save your work ;) !*
5. Download your solution, and upload it to GitHub.com into your personal Exercise 1 repository.

*This week, we upload the exercise manually to GitHub. Next week, you will learn how to pull and push the exercises directly from GitHub to Jupyter Lab using Git!*

.. note::

    Each week, you will create a personal copy of the exercise repository on GitHub.com by clicking on the GitHub classroom link.

    You can also take a look at the template repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Geo-Python-2021/Exercise-1 .
    Note that you are only able to make changes in your personal repository generated via GitHub Classroom.

Summary (what to submit)
------------------------

1. Post a message in the `#week-1 <https://geo-python2021.slack.com/archives/C02D923SLTT>`__ channel at `Geo-Python2021.slack.com <https://geo-python2021.slack.com>`__ with your name, GitHub username and course.
2. Accept Exercise-1 in Github classroom and upload the jupyter notebook (file name should be ``Exercise-1.ipynb``) containing your solutions for Part 3.

.. admonition:: Private repositories
