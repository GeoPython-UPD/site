Lesson overview
===============

During this week, we will introduce you to data visualization and some different modules that can be used to make data plots in Python.
You can create simple plots directly from `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__, for example, but in order to control many aspects of those plots we need to also know how to use the plotting module called `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ and Cartopy.
Matplotlib is an extremely powerful and flexible plotting module, and Cartopy is specialized for plotting maps.

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

- Make basic *x*-*y* plots of data using pandas/Matplotlib
- Manipulate plot formats
- Make basic maps using Cartopy
- Create plots in Jupyter notebooks or save them as separate image files
